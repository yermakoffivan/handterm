## Why handterm

Every terminal emulator is "fast enough." Handterm asks a different question: **how close to the hardware limits can a terminal get?**

Each layer of the pipeline is independently benchmarked against its theoretical floor. The parser is measured against `memcpy`. Cell writes are timed in nanoseconds. Startup is measured in microseconds. The goal is not to be marginally faster, but to understand where the ceilings are and sit as close to them as the hardware allows.

Handterm has both a CPU renderer (softbuffer) and a GPU renderer (wgpu). The current best low-memory path is now a **single-process host architecture**: one long-lived process owns many windows and shares the heavy renderer/runtime state across them. The long-term target remains **<1 MB RSS per additional window**, and the current shared-GPU host is already close to that regime in practice.

## Benchmarks

All measurements below refer to the **current host-based handterm architecture**, not the older one-process-per-window standalone path.

**Test system:** Intel Core Ultra 7 256V, 15 GB RAM, Arch Linux, niri Wayland compositor, 2560x1600 @ 120 Hz.

### What the numbers mean now

Handterm currently has two local architectures:

1. **CPU host** — one process, many CPU-rendered windows
2. **GPU host** — one process, many GPU-rendered windows

(An earlier daemon/thin-client mode was removed after profiling showed the single-process host was the better local low-RAM path.)

### Current measured memory

#### Host memory scaling

| Setup | First window | Each additional |
|-------|-------------:|----------------:|
| handterm CPU host | ~37 MB | ~20 MB |
| **handterm GPU host** | **~61 MB** | **~1-2 MB** |

The current best local low-RAM path is the **shared-GPU host**. It pays a large fixed first-window cost once, then scales cheaply for additional windows.

Measured shared-GPU host scaling on this machine/session:

| Windows | handterm GPU host RSS |
|--------:|-----------------------:|
| 1 | ~61.3 MB |
| 2 | ~63.1 MB |
| 3 | ~64.0 MB |
| 4 | ~65.0 MB |
| 5 | ~67.2 MB |
| 6 | ~68.1 MB |

That puts the incremental cost in roughly the **1-2 MB/window** range after the first window.

#### Why CPU host is still larger per added window

The CPU host path improved substantially, but the dominant remaining per-window cost is the Wayland/softbuffer SHM presentation buffers. In other words, the CPU host is no longer mainly limited by terminal state — it is limited by presentation-buffer memory.

### Current measured startup behavior

#### CPU host

- added-window startup from an existing host: ~**16 ms**

#### GPU host

The shared-GPU host is the best path for memory, but new-window startup is still the main remaining bottleneck. Recent measured `open-window` timings on the shared-GPU host are in the **tens of milliseconds**, with the first extra window sometimes noticeably slower than later ones.

Internal timing instrumentation shows the remaining cost is mostly in:

- **window / surface creation**

not PTY spawn.

### Binary and install size

| Terminal | Binary | Install total | Language |
|----------|-------:|:-------------:|:--------:|
| foot | 477 KB | ~1 MB | C |
| **handterm** | **3.4 MB** | **3.4 MB** | Rust |
| alacritty | 8.9 MB | ~9 MB | Rust |
| kitty | 88 KB\* | ~18 MB | C + Python |
| ghostty | 26 MB | ~29 MB | Zig |

\*kitty's binary is a Python launcher; the real code lives in `/usr/lib/kitty/` (18 MB of `.so` files and Python).

### Thread count

| Terminal | Threads |
|----------|---------:|
| **handterm** | **2** |
| kitty | 7 |
| foot | 9 |
| alacritty | 10 |
| ghostty | 25 |

### Shared library dependencies

Number of unique `.so` files mapped into the process.

| Terminal | Shared libs |
|----------|------------:|
| foot | 22 |
| **handterm** | **24** |
| alacritty | 52 |
| kitty | 85 |
| ghostty | 163 |

### Virtual memory (VSZ)

Total virtual address space mapped (not all resident).

| Terminal | VSZ |
|----------|----:|
| **handterm** | **119 MB** |
| kitty | 463 MB |
| alacritty | 726 MB |
| foot | 1,529 MB |
| ghostty | 2,000 MB |

foot's high VSZ is from mmap'd font files and Wayland protocol buffers; most is not resident. GPU terminals reserve large virtual ranges for driver allocations.

### Multi-window efficiency

| Setup | First window | Each additional |
|-------|-------------:|----------------:|
| foot standalone | 24 MB | +24 MB |
| foot --server + footclient | 25 MB (server) + 1.6 MB | +1.6 MB |
| handterm CPU host | ~37 MB | ~20 MB |
| **handterm GPU host** | **~61 MB** | **~1-2 MB** |

Handterm previously had a daemon/thin-client implementation, but it has been **removed**. After profiling both approaches, the most promising low-RAM local architecture is the **shared-GPU single-process host**. In current live measurements, the first GPU host window pays the full GPU/runtime cost once, and each additional window adds only about **1-2 MB RSS**.

Measured shared-GPU host scaling on this machine/session:

| Windows | handterm GPU host RSS |
|--------:|-----------------------:|
| 1 | ~61.3 MB |
| 2 | ~63.1 MB |
| 3 | ~64.0 MB |
| 4 | ~65.0 MB |
| 5 | ~67.2 MB |
| 6 | ~68.1 MB |

That puts the incremental cost in roughly the **1-2 MB/window** range after the first window.

\* Remaining known Kitty image gaps: handterm now supports the core raw RGB/RGBA/PNG upload-place-delete path, including inline `o=z` compressed payloads, but not the full Kitty graphics protocol surface such as non-inline transports and richer placement/operation parameters.

\* Remaining known Kitty keyboard gaps are limited to keys not currently exposed through `winit`, such as `MEDIA_REVERSE`, `ISO_LEVEL5_SHIFT`, and right-side `Meta`/`Hyper` distinction.

### Pipeline throughput

From `handterm bench`. Internal processing speed, not rendering.

| Stage | ASCII | SGR color | Mixed |
|-------|------:|----------:|------:|
| Theoretical floor (memcpy) | 5,944 MB/s | - | - |
| Theoretical floor (byte scan) | 2,088 MB/s | - | - |
| Parser (state machine) | 279 MB/s | 362 MB/s | 339 MB/s |
| Grid write (parser + cells) | 363 MB/s | 328 MB/s | 259 MB/s |
| Full pipeline | 330 MB/s | 174 MB/s | 209 MB/s |

At 120x72 (HiDPI fullscreen), the pipeline can repaint the entire screen **2,507 times per second**. A 120 Hz display needs 1.

- Fontconfig font discovery with caching

**Shell integration**
- Kitty keyboard protocol set/query/push/pop + expanded CSI-u key encoding, with remaining known gaps limited to keys not exposed through current `winit` input APIs
- XTVERSION response
- OSC 10/11 color queries
- OSC 52 clipboard
- OSC 0/2 window title

**IPC / host control**
- Unix socket remote control (`handterm @ <command>`)
- Host window creation via `handterm open-window`
- Core commands: get-text, send-text, send-key, send-key-event, send-ime-commit, get-cursor, get-size, set-title, close, ls
- Host-specific commands: open-window, focus-window, list-windows
- Synthetic `send-key-event` accepts an optional `physical_key` field for keypad keys, MENU/context-menu, and side-specific modifier variants that `winit` exposes

Examples:

```bash
# Context menu / MENU key via host control
handterm @ send-key-event '{"key":"menu","physical_key":"context_menu"}'

# Keypad center (KP_BEGIN / numpad 5 in navigation mode)
handterm @ send-key-event '{"key":"clear","physical_key":"numpad5"}'

# Right shift press
handterm @ send-key-event '{"key":"shift","physical_key":"shift_right","kind":"press","shift":true}'
```

### Native LaTeX math

Handterm can typeset a LaTeX math body directly into normal terminal cells. It
does not invoke a TeX installation, browser, JavaScript runtime, or image
renderer. The result remains selectable, searchable, and part of scrollback.

From a shell running inside Handterm:

```bash
handterm latex '\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}'
handterm latex '\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix}'
```

The helper emits Handterm's private APC sequence when `TERM_PROGRAM=handterm`.
In another terminal it prints the same terminal-friendly Unicode layout as a
portable fallback. Applications can emit the protocol directly:

```bash
printf '\033_L;%s\033\\' '\sum_{i=0}^{n} i^2'
```

The wire form is `ESC _ L ; <UTF-8 LaTeX body> ESC \\`. Supported constructs
include common symbols and Greek letters, super/subscripts, fractions, roots,
accents, delimiters, matrices, cases, and aligned rows. Unsupported or malformed
input is shown as its original source instead of disappearing.

## Install

### Linux (Wayland)

Requires Wayland, FreeType, and Fontconfig.

```bash
# From source
cargo install --path .

# Or build directly
cargo build --release
./target/release/handterm
```

This default build includes both CPU and GPU frontends. Plain local `handterm` now follows the **host path by default**: when a compatible host is already running, repeated launches reuse that host and open another window in the same process instead of spawning a full new renderer process.

### macOS

handterm runs on macOS (Apple Silicon tested) using the GPU renderer on **Metal**
(via `wgpu`) and a native `winit` window. The terminal core, PTY, IPC remote
control, and single-process multi-window host all work the same as on Linux.

Install the build/runtime prerequisites with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install pkg-config freetype fontconfig
# Recommended default font (matches the bundled config):
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
```

Then build, pointing `pkg-config` at the Homebrew FreeType/Fontconfig:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix freetype)/lib/pkgconfig:$(brew --prefix fontconfig)/lib/pkgconfig"
cargo build --release
./target/release/handterm
```

Platform notes:

- Clipboard uses `pbcopy`/`pbpaste`; `open` is used for URLs (instead of
  `wl-copy`/`wl-paste`/`xdg-open`).
- Font discovery uses the Homebrew `fontconfig` CLIs (`fc-list`/`fc-match`).
  Apple's universal `LastResort` placeholder font is intentionally skipped so
  genuinely missing glyphs are not rendered as labeled boxes.
- Color-emoji fallback retries across the font's fixed bitmap strikes, since
  `Apple Color Emoji` ships some glyphs only at larger sizes.

\* macOS support covers the standalone/host GPU path. The Wayland-specific
window `app_id` is a no-op, and the CPU `softbuffer` backend follows macOS
presentation semantics.

### Build with GPU rendering only

```bash
cargo build --release --features gpu --no-default-features
```

### Build with CPU rendering only

```bash
cargo build --release --features cpu --no-default-features
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/handterm/config.toml`

Generate defaults:

```bash
handterm init-config
```

Example:

```toml
[style]
font_family = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Light"
font_size = 11.0
background = "#000000"
foreground = "#cdd6f4"
cursor = "#f5e0dc"
background_opacity = 0.9

[window]
columns = 120
rows = 32
# Spawn position: "center" (default; centered on the primary monitor, extra
# windows cascade), "auto" (OS decides), or [x, y] physical-pixel offsets
# from the monitor origin. Wayland compositors ignore position hints.
position = "center"

[scrollback]
lines = 10000
smooth = false
smooth_speed = 3.0
scrollbar = true

[performance]
repaint_delay_ms = 5
sync_to_monitor = true
```

`background_opacity` is implemented by the GPU backend. If you force `--backend cpu`, Handterm will stay opaque on Wayland because `softbuffer` presents `Xrgb8888` there.

`scrollback.smooth = true` enables experimental GPU-side fractional scrollback rendering. It keeps the normal terminal/grid model, but the GPU renderer draws one extra row and applies a pixel Y offset so touchpad/pixel wheel input can reveal partial lines. Smooth mode now also adds inertial carry, so quick wheel/trackpad gestures continue gliding instead of stopping immediately.

`scrollback.smooth_speed` controls how far each smooth-scroll gesture travels. The default is `3.0`, which is intentionally more aggressive than the initial 1:1 prototype and pairs with the momentum model to carry farther on flicks.

`scrollback.scrollbar` controls a thin right-edge overlay scrollbar. It is enabled by default and does not consume a terminal column.

This currently applies to the standalone/shared-GPU host path. CPU rendering still uses whole-row scrollback presentation.

## Architecture

```
Single-process host
  |
  +-- window #1
  |     PTY -> parser -> terminal -> grid -> renderer -> Wayland surface
  |
  +-- window #2
  |     PTY -> parser -> terminal -> grid -> renderer -> Wayland surface
  |
  +-- window #N
        PTY -> parser -> terminal -> grid -> renderer -> Wayland surface

Shared across windows in the host:
- event loop
- IPC socket / control plane
- CPU or GPU renderer runtime foundation
- glyph/font resources per DPI
- on the GPU path: shared `wgpu` instance / adapter / device / queue / pipeline cache
```

Each layer is independently benchmarkable. The parser can be tested without a grid. The grid can be tested without a renderer. `handterm bench` measures every boundary.

## Roadmap

See [OPTIMIZATION.md](OPTIMIZATION.md) for the full performance roadmap.

**Architecture status:** handterm is a single-process host architecture. The earlier daemon/thin-client mode was removed after the host path proved better for normal local use.

| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| CPU rendering | Functional terminal with softbuffer | ✅ |
| GPU rendering | wgpu backend with instanced shaders | ✅ |
| Single-process CPU host | Shared-process multi-window CPU runtime | ✅ |
| Shared-GPU host | Low-overhead multi-window GPU runtime | ✅ |
| Server/client mode | Daemon architecture like foot --server | removed (host path won) |
| Startup/per-window polish | Push toward theoretical window-overhead floor | in progress |

**Current best path:** shared-GPU host at roughly **~1-2 MB per extra window** after the first window. The remaining work is shaving startup cost and pushing the incremental slope down further.
